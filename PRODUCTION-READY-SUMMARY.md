- **Stage 3**: Database Import - Populates `campaign_playlists` table

### 2. **Master Orchestrator Script** ✅
- `scripts/run_full_stream_data_pipeline.py`
- Runs all 3 stages with one command
- Error handling and logging
- Cron-job ready

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation** ✅
- **Quick Start**: `STREAM-DATA-QUICK-START.md`
- **Full Workflow**: `AUTOMATED-STREAM-DATA-WORKFLOW.md`
- **Deployment Guide**: `DEPLOY-STREAM-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION.md`
- **Results Summary**: `ROSTER-SCRAPER-DATA-IMPORT-COMPLETE.md`

### 4. **Production Deployment Tools** ✅
- `PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-COMMANDS.sh` - Automated deployment script
- All dependencies documented
- Environment setup instructions

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### Local Environment ✅
- ✅ **79 songs** successfully scraped
- ✅ **741 playlist records** in database
- ✅ **28 campaigns** with stream data
- ✅ Data visible in UI

### Production Environment ⏳
- ⏳ Ready to deploy
- ⏳ Needs data import
- ⏳ Needs cron job setup

## 🚀 Deploy to Production Now

### Option A: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. SSH into production server
ssh user@your-production-server.com

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /var/www/ARTi-project

# 3. Run automated deployment script
bash PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-COMMANDS.sh

# This will:
# - Pull latest code
# - Install dependencies
# - Setup environment
# - Import existing data
# - Schedule cron job
```

### Option B: Manual Deploy

Follow the step-by-step guide in `DEPLOY-STREAM-DATA-TO-PRODUCTION.md`

## 🎬 Quick Production Commands

### 1. Push Latest Code
```bash
# From local machine
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Production
```bash
# SSH into production
ssh user@production-server

# Navigate to project
cd /var/www/ARTi-project

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Run deployment script
bash PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-COMMANDS.sh
```

### 3. Import Existing Data
```bash
# If you have local data files, upload them
scp -r spotify_scraper/data/*.json user@production:/var/www/ARTi-project/spotify_scraper/data/

# Then import
node scripts/import-roster-scraped-data.js
```

### 4. Verify in UI
```
https://your-production-domain.com
→ Navigate to Campaigns
→ Click on a campaign
→ Verify playlist data shows
```

### 5. Schedule Cron Job
```bash
# On production server
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every Sunday at 2 AM):
0 2 * * 0 cd /var/www/ARTi-project && python3 scripts/run_full_stream_data_pipeline.py >> logs/stream_data_workflow.log 2>&1
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results After Deployment

### Database
```sql
-- Should return ~741 or more
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campaign_playlists;

-- Should return ~28 or more
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT campaign_id) FROM campaign_playlists;

-- Should show recent timestamp
SELECT MAX(last_scraped) FROM campaign_playlists;
```

### UI
- ✅ Campaign cards show playlist data
- ✅ Algorithmic playlists section populated
- ✅ Vendor playlists section populated
- ✅ Stream counts displayed (28d, 7d, 12m)
- ✅ Curator information visible

---

## 🔄 Automated Updates

Once the cron job is set up, the workflow will:

1. **Run automatically** every Sunday at 2 AM (or your chosen schedule)
2. **Collect new URLs** from the Roster
3. **Scrape fresh data** for all active campaigns
4. **Update database** with latest stream counts
5. **Log everything** to `logs/stream_data_workflow.log`

### Manual Trigger
```bash
# Run anytime manually
python3 scripts/run_full_stream_data_pipeline.py
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| **URL Collection** | ~15-20 minutes |
| **Stream Scraping** | ~2 minutes per song |
| **Database Import** | ~30 seconds |
| **Total Runtime** | ~2-3 hours for 80 songs |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes

| Issue | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Check logs | `tail -f logs/stream_data_workflow.log` |
| Verify database | `node scripts/import-roster-scraped-data.js` |
| Test S4A login | `cd spotify_scraper && python3 run_roster_urls.py` |
| Check cron | `crontab -l` |

### Common Issues

1. **"No campaigns found"**
   - Upload CSV file to production
   - Verify CSV has active campaigns

2. **"Database connection error"**
   - Check `.env` file has correct credentials
   - Verify Supabase is accessible from production

3. **"Spotify login required"**
   - Run scraper manually once to authenticate
   - Session will persist for future runs
