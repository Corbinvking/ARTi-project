## ⚠️  51 Campaigns Not Found

These are songs that:
1. Were collected from the Roster
2. Successfully scraped stream data
3. But don't yet have campaigns in the database

**Reason**: These songs might be:
- From artists not yet added as clients
- Managed by different S4A accounts
- Listed under different artist names in the CSV

**Solution**: These can be manually reviewed or imported as new campaigns later.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ **View data in UI** - Check that playlist cards show the imported data
2. ✅ **Verify stream counts** - Ensure 28d, 7d, 12m streams are displaying correctly
3. ✅ **Check algorithmic vs vendor playlists** - Ensure proper categorization

### Future Enhancements
1. **Sync playlist data from `campaign_playlists` to `playlists` table**
   - Aggregate playlist performance across campaigns
   - Link to vendors where applicable

2. **Schedule regular scrapes**
   - Run roster scraper weekly/monthly
   - Update stream data automatically

3. **Handle the 51 unmatched campaigns**
   - Create new campaign records
   - Link to appropriate clients
