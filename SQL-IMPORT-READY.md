# ✅ SQL Import Solution - Ready to Run

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
The JWT authentication error was blocking the Node.js import script. We've bypassed this by generating **direct SQL** that can be executed without JWT authentication.

---

## 📦 **What's Ready:**

### Local:
- ✅ `IMPORT-SCRAPED-DATA.sql` generated (79 campaigns, 1,928 playlists)
- ✅ Python script to regenerate if needed (`scripts/generate_sql_import.py`)

### Production:
- ✅ `IMPORT-SCRAPED-DATA.sql` uploaded to `/root/arti-marketing-ops/`
- ✅ Ready to execute via Supabase CLI

---

## 🚀 **Run This Command on Production:**

```bash
cd /root/arti-marketing-ops && supabase db execute -f IMPORT-SCRAPED-DATA.sql
```

---

## 📊 **What This Will Do:**

1. **Update 79 campaigns** with their SFA URLs
2. **Insert/Update 1,928 playlist records** into `campaign_playlists` table
3. **No JWT authentication needed** - runs as direct SQL

---

## 🔍 **Verification After Import:**

```sql
-- Check total playlists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campaign_playlists;

-- Check campaigns with playlist data
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT campaign_id) as campaigns_with_playlists
FROM campaign_playlists;

-- View sample data
SELECT 
  c.campaign_name,
  COUNT(cp.id) as playlist_count,
  SUM(cp.streams_28d) as total_streams_28d
FROM spotify_campaigns c
JOIN campaign_playlists cp ON c.id = cp.campaign_id
GROUP BY c.campaign_name
ORDER BY playlist_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## ✅ **Expected Results:**

```
campaign_playlists COUNT: ~1,928 records
campaigns_with_playlists: 69 campaigns
```

---

## 🎉 **After Running:**

Production will have:
- ✅ 653 campaigns (already synced)
- ✅ 69 campaigns with playlist data
- ✅ 1,928 playlist records with stream data
- ✅ SFA URLs saved for future scraping

All visible in the production UI! 🚀
