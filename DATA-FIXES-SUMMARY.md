# üîß Data Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ‚ùå Problem 1: Duplicate Clients
**Issue**: 754+ duplicate client records in the database (some clients had 8-9 copies)
**Root Cause**: CSV import script was run multiple times without duplicate detection
**Fix Applied**:
- Created `scripts/fix-duplicates-batch.js`
- Batch processed duplicates by client name
- Updated all campaign references to point to the oldest client record
- Deleted 803 total duplicate client records
**Result**: ‚úÖ 259 unique clients remain (no duplicates)

### ‚ùå Problem 2: Vendors Not Populated
**Issue**: No new vendors were created from CSV, vendor data not linked
**Root Cause**: 
- CSV import was storing vendor names as TEXT in `spotify_campaigns.vendor` column
- Not creating vendor records or linking via `vendor_id` foreign key
**Fix Applied**:
- Created `scripts/fix-duplicates-and-vendors.js`
- Extracted unique vendor names from campaigns
- Created vendor records for: Club Restricted, Golden Nugget, Glenn, Moon, House Views, Alekk, Levianth
- Linked 761 campaigns to vendors via `vendor_id`
- Linked 29 campaign playlists to vendors
**Result**: ‚úÖ 8 vendors with proper linkages

### ‚ùå Problem 3: Playlists Not Showing in Vendor Pages
**Issue**: Playlists weren't displaying on vendor cards or in the playlists table
**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend queries `playlists` table
- Our data was in `campaign_playlists` table
- The two tables weren't synced
**Fix Applied**:
- Created `scripts/sync-campaign-playlists-to-playlists-v2.js`
- Aggregated campaign playlist data by playlist name + vendor
- Calculated avg_daily_streams from 28-day stream totals
- Synced 14 unique playlists to the `playlists` table
- Excluded algorithmic playlists (those are only for campaign modals)
**Result**: ‚úÖ 14 playlists now visible in vendor cards

## Current Data State

### Clients
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) as unique_names, COUNT(*) as total
FROM clients;
-- Result: 259 unique names, 259 total records (no duplicates!)
```

### Vendors
```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(DISTINCT sc.id) as campaign_count
FROM vendors v
LEFT JOIN spotify_campaigns sc ON v.id = sc.vendor_id
GROUP BY v.id, v.name
ORDER BY campaign_count DESC;
```

| Vendor | Campaign Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Club Restricted | 498 |
| Golden Nugget | 95 |
| Glenn | 79 |
| Moon | 48 |
| House Views | 17 |
| Levianth | 14 |
| Alekk | 10 |

### Playlists
```sql
SELECT v.name, COUNT(p.id) as playlist_count
FROM vendors v
LEFT JOIN playlists p ON v.id = p.vendor_id
GROUP BY v.name
ORDER BY playlist_count DESC;
```

| Vendor | Playlist Count |
|--------|---------------|
| Club Restricted | 14 |
| Others | 0 (need more scraped data) |

### Campaign-Playlist Links
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_algorithmic = TRUE) as algorithmic,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_algorithmic = FALSE) as vendor_managed
FROM campaign_playlists;
```

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| Total | 29 |
| Algorithmic (Discover Weekly, Radio, etc.) | 11 |
| Vendor Managed | 18 |

## Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/fix-duplicates-batch.js`**
   - Finds duplicate clients by name
   - Updates all campaign references
   - Deletes duplicates in batches

2. **`scripts/fix-duplicates-and-vendors.js`**
   - Comprehensive fix for both issues
   - Creates vendors from campaign data
   - Links campaigns to vendors
   - Links playlists to vendors

3. **`scripts/sync-campaign-playlists-to-playlists-v2.js`**
   - Syncs campaign_playlists to playlists table
   - Aggregates stream data
   - Excludes algorithmic playlists

## What's Now Working

### ‚úÖ UI Features Fixed

1. **Clients Page**
   - No duplicate clients
   - Clean list of 259 unique clients
   - Each client appears once

2. **Vendors/Playlists Page**
   - 8 vendors showing with proper stats
   - Club Restricted shows 14 playlists with stream counts
   - Vendor cards display correctly

3. **Campaign Details Modal**
   - Shows vendor playlists separately from algorithmic playlists
   - Displays "Spotify Algorithmic Playlists" section (Discover Weekly, Radio, etc.)
   - Shows "Vendor Playlists" section with vendor breakdown
   - Stream counts displayed correctly

## Data Flow Verified

## How to Maintain Data Quality

### Weekly Maintenance:
1. **Before CSV Import**: Check for existing data
2. **After CSV Import**: Run duplicate detection
3. **Vendor Sync**: Run vendor linkage script
4. **Playlist Sync**: Run playlist sync script

### Commands to Run:
```bash
# 1. Import CSV
node scripts/import-csv-campaigns-full.js

# 2. Fix any duplicates
node scripts/fix-duplicates-batch.js

# 3. Link vendors
node scripts/fix-duplicates-and-vendors.js

# 4. Sync playlists
node scripts/sync-campaign-playlists-to-playlists-v2.js

# 5. Verify
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients) as clients,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors) as vendors,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM playlists) as playlists,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campaign_playlists) as campaign_playlists,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotify_campaigns WHERE vendor_id IS NOT NULL) as campaigns_with_vendors;
"
```

## Next Steps

### For More Playlist Data:
1. **Run Scraper**: Use `spotify_scraper/run_s4a_list.py` on new SFA links
2. **Populate Data**: Run `scripts/populate-playlist-vendor-data-v2.js` after scraping
3. **Sync to UI**: Run `scripts/sync-campaign-playlists-to-playlists-v2.js`

### For Better Vendor Data:
- Other vendors (Golden Nugget, Glenn, Moon, etc.) need scraped playlist data
- Once you have more scraped files, the same scripts will populate them automatically

## ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved!

- ‚úÖ No duplicate clients
- ‚úÖ Vendors created and linked to campaigns
- ‚úÖ Playlists visible in vendor cards
- ‚úÖ Campaign modal shows playlists with vendor info
- ‚úÖ Algorithmic playlists separated from vendor playlists
- ‚úÖ Stream counts displaying correctly
