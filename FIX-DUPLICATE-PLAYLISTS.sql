-- Fix duplicate playlists by keeping the older, higher-quality records

-- Strategy: For each duplicate playlist name, keep the one with:
-- 1. The highest stream count (more accurate data)
-- 2. If stream counts are equal, keep the older one (earlier last_scraped)

-- This will delete 7 duplicate records

-- Delete duplicates for "Your DJ" (keep 474, delete 35)
