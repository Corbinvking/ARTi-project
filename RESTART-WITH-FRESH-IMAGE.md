# Restart Container with Fresh Image

## 🎉 **SUCCESS: spotify.js IS being compiled!** 

The debug build shows `spotify.js` (10,980 bytes) is created successfully. The issue is the running container is using an old image.

## 🚀 **Commands to fix:**

```bash
# 1. Stop the current container
docker stop supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops

# 2. Remove the old container (important!)
docker rm supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops

# 3. Rebuild the production image (this should now work)
docker build --no-cache -t arti-marketing-ops-api apps/api/

# 4. Restart all services to recreate the container with the fresh image
./start-platform-production.sh

# 5. Verify spotify.js exists in the new container
docker exec supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops ls -la /app/dist/routes/spotify.js

# 6. Test the Spotify routes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/providers/spotify/health
```

## 🎯 **What happened:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works perfectly
- ✅ `spotify.js` gets created (10,980 bytes)
- ❌ Old container was still running with cached image

**Run these commands to get your Spotify scraper routes working!** 🚀
