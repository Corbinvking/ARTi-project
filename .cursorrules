# Cursor Rules for ARTi Platform

> **Note**: This legacy file is kept for backward compatibility. All rules have been migrated to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files which are more reliable for cloud agents and agent mode. See the rules directory for the authoritative versions.

## Quick Start

**Before starting ANY task, read:**
1. `docs/AGENT-QUICK-START.md` - Essential reference
2. `docs/BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md` - Navigation guide
3. `docs/AGENTIC-INFRASTRUCTURE.md` - Issue pipeline guide

**Branch naming**: `{type}/{app}/{description}` (e.g., `feature/spotify/playlist-filter`)
