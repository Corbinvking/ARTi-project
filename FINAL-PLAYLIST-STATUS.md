| Source            | Count | Reason                                           |
|-------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|

| CSV Import (Full) | 16    | New campaigns - playlists not confirmed yet     |

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: CSV Campaigns Had Wrong Status
**Problem**: 223 CSV-imported campaigns had `status = NULL` instead of "Active"
**Fix**: Created `scripts/fix-csv-campaign-statuses.js` to update all to "Active"
**Result**: ✅ All CSV campaigns now show as Active

### Issue 2: Vendor "Majed" Missing
**Problem**: 3 active campaigns had playlist data but no vendor (vendor "Majed" didn't exist in database)
**Fix**: Created `scripts/create-missing-vendor-and-playlists.js`
**Result**: ✅ Vendor "Majed" created and 3 campaigns linked

### Issue 3: Playlists Not Created from CSV Data
**Problem**: CSV import stored playlist names but didn't create `campaign_playlists` records
**Fix**: Created `scripts/create-playlists-from-csv-data.js`
**Result**: ✅ 813 playlist records created and linked to campaigns

## 🎵 Playlist Distribution by Vendor

| Vendor          | Playlists | Active Campaigns |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Club Restricted | 701       | ~170             |
| Glenn           | 60        | ~20              |
| Golden Nugget   | 35        | ~10              |
| Majed           | 3         | 3                |
| Moon            | ~10       | ~5               |
| Others          | ~4        | ~1               |
| **Total**       | **~813**  | **209**          |

## 🔍 Understanding the 262 Campaigns Without Playlists

### 1. Airtable Imports (246 campaigns) - 52.2% of active campaigns

These are **historical campaigns** imported from an older Airtable system before the current playlist tracking was implemented.

**Why they don't have playlists:**
- Imported before CSV playlist tracking system
- Playlist data was not captured in Airtable
- Would require manual backfilling or scraper discovery

**Options:**
- ✅ **Keep as-is**: These are older campaigns, playlist tracking may not be critical
- ⚠️ **Archive them**: Mark as historical and hide from active view
- 🔄 **Run scraper**: Attempt to auto-discover playlists via Spotify scraper

### 2. CSV Campaigns Without Playlist Data (16 campaigns) - 3.4% of active campaigns

These are **new campaigns** from the CSV where the "Playlists" column is empty.

**Campaign Examples:**
- "Reece Rosé - Back Back" (Club Restricted)
- "Harel - Look Twice" (Club Restricted)
- "Neyvo - I Want You" (no vendor)
- "Friendly Fire - Saving" (no vendor)
- "Karma - Perfect Angel BB" (no vendor)
- "Filthy - Break The Pattern" (Golden Nugget)

**Why they don't have playlists:**
- Campaigns are newly created
- Playlists haven't been confirmed by vendor yet
- Or vendor hasn't provided placement data

**Next Steps:**
- Follow up with vendors for playlist confirmation
- Update CSV or database when playlist info becomes available
- Run Spotify scraper to auto-discover playlists

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Campaign Details Modal
When you click on any of the **209 active campaigns with playlists**, the modal displays:
- ✅ **Playlists Tab**: Shows all playlists the song is placed on
- ✅ **Vendor Information**: Vendor name and cost per 1K streams
- ✅ **Stream Data**: 28-day streams per playlist (when scraped)
- ✅ **Vendor Performance**: Breakdown by vendor
- ✅ **Algorithmic Playlists**: Separate section for Discover Weekly, Radio, etc.

### Vendor Pages
Navigate to the Playlists page and select any vendor:
- ✅ **Club Restricted**: Shows 701 playlists
- ✅ **Glenn**: Shows 60 playlists
- ✅ **Golden Nugget**: Shows 35 playlists
- ✅ **Majed**: Shows 3 playlists

### Client Cards
When viewing a client:
- ✅ All campaigns for that client display
- ✅ Campaigns with playlists show playlist count
- ✅ Click through to Campaign Details Modal to see full playlist data
