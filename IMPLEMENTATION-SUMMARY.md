# Implementation Summary - Comprehensive Data Population

## 🎯 What We've Accomplished

### 1. Separated Algorithmic vs Vendor Playlists ✅
- **Database**: Added `is_algorithmic` column to `campaign_playlists`
- **UI**: Campaign modal now shows two distinct sections:
  - **Spotify Algorithmic Playlists** (Discover Weekly, Radio, etc.) with green badges
  - **Vendor Playlists** (paid placements) grouped by vendor
- **Script**: `populate-playlist-vendor-data-v2.js` automatically separates playlists

### 2. S4A List Scraper ✅
- **Script**: `spotify_scraper/run_s4a_list.py`
- **Function**: Automatically scrapes all songs from `s4alist.md`
- **Output**: Creates JSON files in `spotify_scraper/data/`

### 3. Comprehensive CSV Import ✅
- **Script**: `scripts/import-csv-campaigns-full.js`
- **Coverage**: Imports ALL 23 columns from the CSV
- **New Data Captured**:
  - Daily/Weekly stream rates
  - Remaining streams (for progress tracking)
  - Vendor payment status
  - Curator response status
  - Action flags (notify vendor, ask for SFA)
  - Historical playlists
  - All client emails
  - Verification flags
  - Last modified timestamps

### 4. Enhanced Database Schema ✅
- **Migration**: `034_enhance_campaign_tracking.sql`
- **New Fields in spotify_campaigns**:
  - `daily_streams`, `weekly_streams` - Performance metrics
  - `paid_vendor`, `payment_date` - Payment tracking
  - `curator_status` - Playlist curator responses
  - `notify_vendor`, `ask_for_sfa` - Action items
  - `historical_playlists`, `playlist_links` - CSV playlist data
  - `last_modified_csv` - Audit trail
  
- **New Fields in clients**:
  - `email_secondary`, `email_tertiary` - Additional contacts
  - `verified` - Data quality flag

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

**Local:**
```bash
Get-Content supabase/migrations/034_enhance_campaign_tracking.sql | docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres
```

**Production:**
```bash
ssh root@artistinfluence.com
cd /root/arti-marketing-ops
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres < supabase/migrations/034_enhance_campaign_tracking.sql
```

### Step 2: Import CSV Data

```bash
# Set environment variable
$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# Run comprehensive import
node scripts/import-csv-campaigns-full.js
```

This will:
- Create/update all clients with full contact info
- Import all campaign data with performance metrics
- Set up campaign groups
- Link vendors
- Track payment and curator statuses
- Preserve historical playlist data

### Step 3: Scrape Playlist Data

```bash
cd spotify_scraper
python run_s4a_list.py
```

This will scrape playlist data for all songs in `s4alist.md`.

### Step 4: Populate Playlist-Vendor Links

```bash
cd ..
node scripts/populate-playlist-vendor-data-v2.js
```

This will:
- Match scraped playlists to campaigns
- Separate algorithmic from vendor playlists
- Calculate stream counts
- Link to vendors

### Performance Calculations

```javascript
// Progress percentage
const progress = ((goal - remaining) / goal) * 100;

// Daily velocity
const dailyVelocity = daily_streams;

// Days to completion (at current rate)
const daysToComplete = remaining / daily_streams;

// Vendor performance
const vendorStreams = sum(campaigns.where(vendor === X).daily_streams);
const vendorRevenue = sum(campaigns.where(vendor === X).sale_price);
const vendorROI = vendorStreams / (vendorRevenue / 1000);
```
