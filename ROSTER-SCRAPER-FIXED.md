# 🔧 Roster Scraper - Search Bar Fix Applied!

## ❌ **Problem Found**

The initial run showed:
- Only finding 24-25 artists out of 600+
- Artists not being matched
- No SFA URLs collected

**Root Cause**: The Roster has 600+ artists with pagination. The scraper was only loading the first page (25 artists) instead of using the search functionality.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

Updated `roster_page.py` to use the **Roster search bar**:

1. **Detects search input** with multiple selectors
2. **Types artist name** into search bar
3. **Waits for filtered results**
4. **Finds artist** in filtered list
5. **Extracts SFA URL** from matched artist

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ No need to load all 600+ artists
- ✅ Handles pagination automatically
- ✅ Faster (direct search)
- ✅ More reliable matching

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Option 1: Quick Test (5 clients)**
```bash
cd roster_scraper
python test_search.py
```

This will test with:
- Segan
- Reece Rosé
- Hitskope
- dack janiels
- Jordan (Harden)

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Found in Roster: 5/5
📝 SFA URLs Collected: ~15-20
✅ SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY WORKING!
```

### **Option 2: Full Run (106 clients)**
```bash
python run_roster_scraper.py
```

**Expected results:**
- ~90-100 clients found
- ~200-220 SFA URLs collected
- ~40-60 minutes total runtime

---

## 📊 **What Changed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```python
# Tried to load ALL artists (only got first page)
artists = await self.get_all_artists()  # Only 25 artists
# Then search manually
for artist in artists:
    if match(artist_name):
        return artist
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```python
# Use the search bar
search_input = await self.page.wait_for_selector('input[placeholder*="roster"]')
await search_input.type(artist_name)
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Wait for results

# Get filtered results
artist_elements = await self.page.query_selector_all('a[href*="/artist/"]')
# Now we get the actual artist!
```

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Run Quick Test**
```bash
python test_search.py
```

Verify that:
- Search bar is found
- Artists are matched
- SFA URLs are extracted

### **Step 2: Run Full Scrape** (if test passes)
```bash
python run_roster_scraper.py
```

### **Step 3: Check Results**
Look in `data/` for:
- `sfa-urls-simple_TIMESTAMP.txt` ← Use this with existing scraper
- `sfa-urls-from-roster_TIMESTAMP.md` ← Detailed view
- `roster_scraping_results_TIMESTAMP.json` ← Complete data

## 💡 **Expected Results After Fix**

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Artists Found | 0/106 | ~90-100/106 |
| SFA URLs | 0 | ~200-220 |
| Success Rate | 0% | 85-95% |

**Why not 100%?**
- Some clients are managers (not artists)
- Some artist names don't match exactly
- Some songs may not be in this Roster account

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If search bar not found:**
```
⚠️  Search bar not found, falling back to manual search
```
**Solution**: The scraper will try manual search as fallback.

### **If artist still not found:**
```
❌ Artist not found: X
```
**Possible causes**:
1. Artist name in CSV doesn't match Roster name
2. Artist is managed by different account
3. Client is a manager/label (not the artist)

**Check**: Look at the Campaign name (e.g., "Segan - DNBMF") - the artist is "Segan", not the client name.

### **If many artists fail:**
- Verify correct S4A account is logged in
- Check if Roster page layout changed
- Try increasing wait times in the code
