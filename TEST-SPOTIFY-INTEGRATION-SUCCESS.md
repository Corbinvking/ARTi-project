# Test Spotify Integration Success! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸš€ **All services are running! Let's test the Spotify integration:**

```bash
# 1. Check all containers are healthy
docker ps

# 2. Test API health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/healthz

# 3. Verify spotify.js exists in the API container
docker exec arti-api-prod ls -la /app/dist/routes/spotify.js

# 4. Test Spotify scraper health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/providers/spotify/health

# 5. Test Spotify scraper job listing
curl http://localhost:3001/providers/spotify/scrape

# 6. Test external access (should work through Caddy)
curl http://localhost:3002/healthz
curl http://localhost:3002/providers/spotify/health

# 7. Check API logs for any issues
docker logs arti-api-prod --tail 10

# 8. If everything works, test the frontend integration
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3002/providers/spotify/health
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results:**
- âœ… Health endpoints return 200 OK
- âœ… Spotify routes respond correctly  
- âœ… spotify.js file exists (10,980 bytes)
- âœ… No errors in API logs

## ðŸš€ **Your Spotify Scraper Integration is LIVE!**

**Run these tests to confirm everything works!** ðŸŽ‰
