# Debug Route Registration Issue

## 🔍 **The Problem:**
- ✅ API builds successfully (TypeScript fixed)
- ✅ API container is healthy
- ❌ Scraper routes still return 404 (not registered)

## 🔧 **Debug Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Check API container logs for route registration
docker logs supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops --tail 50

# 2. Check if routes are being loaded at startup
docker logs supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops | grep -i route
docker logs supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops | grep -i spotify
docker logs supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops | grep -i provider

# 3. Test if provider routes are working at all
curl http://localhost:3002/api/providers/health

# 4. Check what routes ARE available
curl http://localhost:3002/api/
curl http://localhost:3002/
```

## 🎯 **What to Look For:**
- Route registration messages in logs
- Any errors loading the spotify module
- Whether `/api/providers/health` works (base provider route)
- Whether the spotify route module is being imported

**Run these commands to see what's happening during startup!** 🔍
