## 🔧 Fixes Applied

**Problem**: Script tried to insert `email` into vendors table, but column doesn't exist  
**Fix**: Removed email handling from vendor sync script  
**Result**: ✅ All 9 vendors synced successfully

### **Issue #2: Boolean "checked" String**
**Problem**: CSV has "checked" string, database expects boolean  
**Fix**: Added `normalizeBoolean()` function to convert:
- "checked" → `true`
- "" or "false" → `false`
- null → `null`

**Result**: ✅ All 653 campaigns synced successfully

```

**Expected**: Playlist data for ~590 campaigns

### **3. Import Stream Data**

Import the scraped JSON data into the database:

```bash
node scripts/import-roster-scraped-data.js
```

**Expected**: Populate `campaign_playlists` table with stream data

### **4. Deploy to Production**
