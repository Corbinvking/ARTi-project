🚨 POST-RECOVERY ANALYSIS & RESOLUTION SUMMARY
===============================================

🔍 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:
1. ❌ JWT Token Misconfiguration - RESOLVED ✅
   - Root Cause: `npx supabase status` showed fake API keys instead of real JWT tokens
   - Solution: Used real JWT tokens from kong.yml configuration
   - Impact: Full admin authentication restored, frontend-backend communication working

2. ❌ Missing n8n Automation Service - RESOLVED ✅  
   - Root Cause: n8n container was created but not running
   - Solution: Restarted docker-compose.supabase-project.yml services
   - Impact: n8n automation platform now accessible on port 5678

3. ❌ Data Persistence Concerns - ADDRESSED ✅
