# Deploy Client Emails to Production

## Overview
This deployment populates the `emails` array column in the `clients` table from the `client_email` data in `spotify_campaigns`.

## Steps

### 1. SSH into Production Server
```bash
ssh root@artistinfluence.com
cd ~/arti-marketing-ops
```

### 2. Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 3. Apply Email Population Script
```bash
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres < scripts/populate-client-emails.sql
```

### 4. Verify Email Population
```bash
# Check some clients with emails
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT name, emails FROM clients WHERE emails IS NOT NULL AND array_length(emails, 1) > 0 ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;"

# Check counts
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE emails IS NOT NULL AND array_length(emails, 1) > 0) as with_emails, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE emails IS NULL OR array_length(emails, 1) = 0) as without_emails, COUNT(*) as total FROM clients;"
```

### 5. Test Frontend
1. Navigate to https://app.artistinfluence.com/spotify/clients
2. Verify that the email icons show correct counts (e.g., "ðŸ“§ 1" for clients with one email)
3. Hover over the email icon to see the tooltip with actual email addresses
4. Verify it looks exactly like the local instance

## Expected Results
- Clients should have their `emails` populated from `spotify_campaigns.client_email`
- Frontend should display email counts with icons
- Tooltips should show actual email addresses on hover
- Display should match the local instance exactly

## Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Clear all emails
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "UPDATE clients SET emails = NULL;"
```

## Notes
- This script only updates clients that have associated campaigns with `client_email` data
- Clients without campaign data will have `NULL` or empty email arrays
- The script filters out invalid email entries (empty, comma-separated values, etc.)
