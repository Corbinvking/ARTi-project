# Campaign Structure Refactoring - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Changes ✅
- **Created `campaign_groups` table** - Represents actual campaigns (can have multiple songs)
- **Added columns to `spotify_campaigns`**:
  - `campaign_group_id` - Links songs to their parent campaign
  - `plays_last_7d` - Spotify streams in last 7 days
  - `plays_last_3m` - Spotify streams in last 3 months
  - `plays_last_12m` - Spotify streams in last 12 months
  - `playlist_adds` - Number of playlist additions
  - `saves` - Number of saves
- **Created SQL functions**:
  - `get_campaign_group_with_songs(uuid)` - Fetch complete campaign with all songs
  - `get_client_campaigns(uuid)` - Fetch all campaigns for a client

### 2. Data Migration ✅
- **Populated campaign names** from CSV (261 campaigns matched)
- **Grouped songs into campaigns** - Created 203 campaign groups
- **Linked 261 songs** to their parent campaigns

### 3. Frontend Updates ✅
- **Created `useCampaignGroups.ts` hook** - Fetch and manage campaign groups
- **Updated `CampaignHistory.tsx`** - Now queries `campaign_groups` instead of individual songs
- **Updated `useClients.ts`** - Client list now shows campaign group counts
- **Updated `useClient` hook** - Client details now fetch campaign groups with aggregated metrics
- **Created `CampaignGroupList.tsx`** - New component for displaying grouped campaigns

## Data Structure

### Before Refactoring:
```
spotify_campaigns table:
- Each row = 1 song placement with 1 vendor
- No grouping of related songs
- Duplicated campaign data across rows
```

### After Refactoring:
```
campaign_groups table:
- Each row = 1 campaign (e.g., "Reece Rosé - Back Back")
- Aggregated metrics (total_goal, total_budget)
- Links to multiple songs

spotify_campaigns table:
- Each row = 1 song placement with 1 vendor
- Links to parent campaign via campaign_group_id
- Includes stream analytics fields for future data
```

## Example:

**Campaign**: "SCRIPT - Mr. Rager" (100,000 streams, $1,400, Active)
```
├── Song 1: SCRIPT - Mr. Rager → Club Restricted (50,000 streams)
└── Song 2: SCRIPT - Mr. Rager → Glenn (50,000 streams)
```

**Campaign**: "Kluster Flux - Final Flash" (30,000 streams, $750)
```
├── Song 1: Kluster Flux - Final Flash → Levianth (10,000 streams)
├── Song 2: Kluster Flux - Final Flash → Golden Nugget (10,000 streams)
└── Song 3: Kluster Flux - Final Flash → Moon (10,000 streams)
```

## UI Changes

### Campaign List Page (`/spotify/campaigns`)
- Now shows campaigns (not individual songs)
- Each row displays:
  - ✅ Campaign name (e.g., "Reece Rosé - Back Back")
  - ✅ Client name
  - ✅ Status badge (Draft, Active, Pending, Complete, etc.)
  - ✅ Total daily streams (sum of all songs)
  - ✅ Total weekly streams (sum of all songs)
  - ✅ Total remaining streams
  - ✅ Progress bar and percentage
  - ✅ Invoice status (Not Invoiced, Sent, Paid)
  - ✅ Performance indicator

### Client Tab (`/spotify/clients`)
- Client list now shows campaign group counts (not song counts)
- Clicking a client shows their campaign groups
- Each campaign displays aggregated metrics

## Stream Analytics Fields (for future use)

Added to `spotify_campaigns` table:
- `plays_last_7d` - Recent performance tracking
- `plays_last_3m` - Medium-term trends
- `plays_last_12m` - Long-term performance
- `playlist_adds` - Playlist growth
- `saves` - User engagement

These fields are ready for integration with Spotify API data.

## Local Testing

✅ Migration applied locally
✅ 203 campaign groups created
✅ 261 songs linked to campaigns
✅ Frontend updated to query campaign_groups
✅ Client campaigns now show grouped data

## Next Steps for Production

1. SSH into production server
2. Pull latest changes (`git pull origin main`)
3. Apply migration: `docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres < supabase/migrations/028_create_campaign_groups.sql`
4. Populate campaign names: `node scripts/populate-campaign-names.js`
5. Group campaigns: `node scripts/group-campaigns.js`
6. Verify: Check `/spotify/campaigns` and `/spotify/clients` pages
