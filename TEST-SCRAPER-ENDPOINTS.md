# Test Scraper Endpoints (Build Successful!)

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps - Test the Endpoints:**

```bash
# 1. Restart the API container with the new build
docker restart supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops

# 2. Wait for startup
sleep 15

# 3. Test basic API health
curl http://localhost:3002/health

# 4. Test the scraper health endpoint (was 404 before)
curl http://localhost:3002/api/providers/spotify/health

# 5. Test scraper job endpoints
curl http://localhost:3002/api/providers/spotify/scrape

# 6. Test creating a scraper job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/providers/spotify/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"songUrls": ["https://artists.spotify.com/c/artist/test/song/example"]}'
```

## âœ… **Expected Results:**
- âœ… API health: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0","service":"arti-marketing-api"}`
- âœ… **Scraper health: Should return health metrics (not 404!)**
- âœ… Scraper jobs: Should return job list
- âœ… Job creation: Should accept the request (may require auth)

## ðŸŽ¯ **This Should Fix:**
- âœ… No more 404 on `/api/providers/spotify/health`
- âœ… All scraper routes now functional
- âœ… Frontend integration ready to work!

**Run these commands and let me know what the scraper endpoints return!** ðŸŽµ
