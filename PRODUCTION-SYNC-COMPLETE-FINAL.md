## Database State

### Campaign Groups:
- "Segan - DNBMF" â†’ 1 song, 20 playlists (13 unique after deduplication)
- "Segan - Tempo" â†’ 1 song, 2 playlists
- "Segan" â†’ 1 song ("Segan - The Same"), 0 playlists

### Total Data:
- **1,433 total playlist records** in production
- **47 algorithmic playlists** (across all campaigns)
- **1,386 vendor playlists** (across all campaigns)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### 1. Prevent Future Duplicates
Update `scripts/populate-playlist-vendor-data-v2.js` to properly update existing records instead of creating duplicates.

**Current issue**: The script inserts new records even if a playlist already exists.

**Solution**: Implement proper upsert logic:
```javascript
// Check if playlist exists
const { data: existing } = await supabase
  .from('campaign_playlists')
  .select('id')
  .eq('campaign_id', campaignId)
  .eq('playlist_name', playlistName)
  .single();

if (existing) {
  // Update existing record
  await supabase
    .from('campaign_playlists')
    .update({ streams_28d, last_scraped: new Date() })
    .eq('id', existing.id);
} else {
  // Insert new record
  await supabase.from('campaign_playlists').insert({ ... });
}
```

### 2. Populate Other Campaigns
Run the scraper and data import for other campaigns to populate their playlist data.

### 3. Monitor Data Quality
Periodically check for:
- Duplicate playlist records
- Empty campaign groups
- Mismatched campaign routing

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# SSH to production
ssh root@artistinfluence.com
cd /root/arti-marketing-ops

# Check campaign routing
docker exec supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
SELECT 
    cg.name,
    COUNT(sc.id) as songs,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cp.playlist_name) as unique_playlists
FROM campaign_groups cg
LEFT JOIN spotify_campaigns sc ON sc.campaign_group_id = cg.id
LEFT JOIN campaign_playlists cp ON cp.campaign_id = sc.id
WHERE cg.name LIKE '%Segan%'
GROUP BY cg.name;
"
```

Expected output:
```
     name      | songs | unique_playlists
---------------+-------+------------------
 Segan         |     1 |                0
 Segan - DNBMF |     1 |               13
 Segan - Tempo |     1 |                2
```
