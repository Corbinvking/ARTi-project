# 🎉 Production 406 Error - FIXED!

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The persistent 406 error on production was caused by **`useCampaignOverallPerformance`** hook in:
```
apps/frontend/app/(dashboard)/spotify/stream-strategist/hooks/useCampaignPerformanceData.ts
```

### The Problem
Line 133-137 was querying the OLD `campaigns` table:
```typescript
const { data: campaign, error: campaignError } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')  // ❌ This table doesn't exist in production!
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', campaignId)
  .single();
```

## ✅ **The Fix**

### 1. Changed table from `campaigns` to `campaign_groups`
```typescript
const { data: campaign, error: campaignError } = await supabase
  .from('campaign_groups')  // ✅ Correct table
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', campaignId)
  .single();
```

### 2. Updated field references
Changed `campaign.stream_goal` to `campaign.total_goal` (matching the `campaign_groups` schema):
```typescript
return {
  campaign_goal: campaign.total_goal || 0,  // ✅ Correct field
  // ...
  progress_percentage: (campaign.total_goal || 0) > 0 ? (totalActual / (campaign.total_goal || 1)) * 100 : 0,
};
```

## 🎯 **Why It Was Hard to Find**

1. **Multiple queries executing**: The modal was calling TWO queries:
   - `fetchCampaignDetails()` → ✅ Already fixed (queries `campaign_groups`)
   - `useCampaignPerformanceData()` → ❌ Was still querying old `campaigns` table

2. **New code WAS deployed**: Console showed `🔄 [v1.0.1]` proving the new code was running

3. **Hidden in a nested hook**: The bad query was in `useCampaignOverallPerformance`, which is called by `useCampaignPerformanceData`, which is called by `CampaignDetailsModal`

## 📝 **Deployment Details**

- **Commit**: `2e017fe` - "fix: Found and fixed the 406 error"
- **Files Changed**:
  - `apps/frontend/app/(dashboard)/spotify/stream-strategist/hooks/useCampaignPerformanceData.ts`
  - `apps/frontend/app/(dashboard)/spotify/stream-strategist/components/CampaignDetailsModal.tsx` (added debug logs)
  - `PRODUCTION-406-DIAGNOSIS.md` (analysis doc)

## ⏰ **Next Steps**

1. ✅ Code deployed to GitHub
2. ⏳ Wait 3-5 minutes for Vercel to build
3. 🧪 Test in production incognito mode
4. 🎉 Confirm playlist data appears correctly

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

Once deployed, you should see:
1. ✅ **No more 406 errors** in console
2. ✅ **Playlist data appears** in campaign cards (like "Segan - DNBMF")
3. ✅ **Algorithmic playlists** show at the top
4. ✅ **Vendor playlists** show below

## 🎓 **Lesson Learned**

Always check **ALL hooks** that might be triggered when a component mounts, especially:
- `useQuery` hooks with `enabled: !!someId`
- Performance/analytics hooks
- Realtime subscriptions
- Derived queries

These can be "invisible" sources of database queries that don't show up in the main component code!
