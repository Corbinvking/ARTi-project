# Vendor Association Setup Complete! üéâ

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Vendor Records ‚úÖ
The following vendor records now exist in your local database:
- **Club Restricted** (b3479cce-fed8-40e4-b778-1a9958463576)
- **Glenn** (73224a4b-2feb-4e0e-b8ec-224d8d8ee02f)
- **Majed** (b901a4ad-9fa7-4c6e-9b30-924b6fa8ad62)
- **Golden Nugget**, **Alekk**, **Gloomy Guy** (created but no users yet)

### 2. Synced Auth Users ‚úÖ
All users from `auth.users` have been synced to `public.users` table. This was necessary because the `vendor_users` table has a foreign key constraint to `public.users`, not `auth.users`.

### 3. Created Vendor Associations ‚úÖ
- `vendor1@arti-demo.com` ‚Üí **Club Restricted**
- `vendor2@arti-demo.com` ‚Üí **Glenn**
- `vendor3@arti-demo.com` ‚Üí **Majed**

## Testing the Vendor Portal

### Login Credentials
You can now log in as any of these vendor users:

| Email | Password | Vendor |
|-------|----------|--------|
| vendor1@arti-demo.com | password123 | Club Restricted |
| vendor2@arti-demo.com | password123 | Glenn |
| vendor3@arti-demo.com | password123 | Majed |

### What to Expect

1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Log in** with one of the vendor credentials above
3. **You should be automatically redirected** to `/spotify/vendor` (the vendor portal)
4. **You should see**:
   - The vendor name in the header (e.g., "Club Restricted - Manage your playlists and campaigns")
   - **Sample data populated**:
     - **Club Restricted**: 3 playlists, 16,500 total daily streams
     - **Glenn**: 2 playlists, 8,000 total daily streams
     - **Majed**: 2 playlists, 13,700 total daily streams
   - Playlists displayed with:
     - Playlist name
     - Daily stream count
     - Follower count
     - Manage button
   - Empty states for:
     - My Active Campaigns: "No active campaigns" (no campaign assignments yet)
     - Campaign Participation Requests: "No requests yet"

5. **You should NOT see**:
   - ‚ùå "No Vendor Association Found" error
   - ‚ùå Dashboard, Spotify, or SoundCloud navigation items (vendors should only see their portal)

## Next Steps

‚úÖ **Vendor associations are working with sample data!**

### Current State
- Vendors have sample playlists with realistic metrics
- Vendors can log in and see their playlists
- Vendors can add new playlists via the "Add Playlist" button
- Vendors can manage their playlists

### To Add Campaign Data
To populate active campaigns and campaign participation requests:

#### Option A: Import from Full CSV
Run the full scraping and import flow to populate campaigns:
```bash
.\RUN-SCRAPE-AND-IMPORT.ps1
```

#### Option B: Copy from Production
Export campaign_playlists and spotify_campaigns from production and import to local.

#### Option C: Use the Admin Portal
Log in as admin and create campaigns, then assign vendors to them.

## Scripts Created

- `scripts/sync-auth-to-users.js` - Syncs auth.users to public.users
- `scripts/create-vendor-associations.js` - Creates vendor records and associations
- `scripts/import-vendor-sample-data.js` - Imports sample playlists for vendors
- `scripts/check-vendor-data.js` - Shows what data each vendor has
- `scripts/fix-vendor-passwords.js` - Resets vendor passwords and confirms emails
- `scripts/debug-vendor-users.js` - Debug tool for vendor_users issues

## Technical Details

### Issue 1: Foreign Key Constraint
The `vendor_users.user_id` references `public.users(id)`, not `auth.users(id)`. The vendor users were created in `auth.users` by the recovery script, but they didn't exist in `public.users`, causing the foreign key constraint violation.

**Fix**: Sync all `auth.users` to `public.users`, then create the `vendor_users` associations.

### Issue 2: RLS Policy Blocking Vendor Access
The RLS policy on `vendor_users` (`vendor_users_org_isolation`) required users to be in the `memberships` table with matching `org_id`. However, vendor users don't use the memberships system - they have their own `vendor_users` association table.

**Fix**: Created new RLS policies in migration `999_fix_vendor_users_rls.sql`:
- `vendors_can_view_own_mapping` - Allows vendors to view their own `vendor_users` entry
- `admin_manager_can_view_vendor_mappings` - Allows admins/managers to view all vendor mappings in their org
- `admin_manager_can_manage_vendor_mappings` - Allows admins/managers to manage vendor mappings

**Ready to test!** üöÄ Open http://localhost:3000 and log in as a vendor.
