## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### Quick Deployment (Recommended)

**Copy and paste this ONE command on production server:**

```bash
cd /root/arti-marketing-ops && git pull origin main && npm install && export SUPABASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:54321" && export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU" && node scripts/import-csv-playlists-enhanced.js && node scripts/populate-playlist-vendor-data-v2.js && node scripts/sync-campaign-playlists-to-playlists-v2.js && docker-compose restart
```

**Time:** ~10-15 minutes

## 📈 Expected Results

### Before Deployment (Production Current)
- Campaigns: 208
- Campaign Playlists: 1,148
- Active Campaigns: 485
- Campaigns with Playlists: 208 (43%)

### After Deployment (Production Target)
- Campaigns: 255 ✅
- Campaign Playlists: ~1,850 ✅
- Active Campaigns: 485 ✅
- Campaigns with Playlists: 253 (46%) ✅

### Improvement
- **+47 campaigns** with playlist data
- **+702 playlists** added (543 vendor + 173 algorithmic)
- **+62% increase** in total playlists
- **8 campaigns** with full structure (algorithmic + vendor)

---

## 🎯 What Each Campaign Will Show

### Campaigns with Full Structure (8 campaigns)
**Example: Segan - DNBMF**
- ✅ **Spotify Algorithmic Playlists** section at top
  - Your DJ, Discover Weekly, Radio, etc.
  - Total algorithmic streams
  - Green indicators
- ✅ **Vendor Playlists** section below
  - Vendor name and cost per 1K streams
  - Individual playlist names and streams
  - Total vendor streams
  - Vendor performance breakdown

### Campaigns with Vendor-Only Data (247 campaigns)
**Example: All American Rejects - Easy Come, Easy Go**
- ✅ **Vendor Playlists** section
  - Vendor information
  - Playlist names and streams
  - Performance metrics
- ❌ No algorithmic section (requires scraping)

---

## 🔍 Verification After Deployment

### Database Checks

```bash
# Check playlist counts
docker exec -i supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
SELECT 
  'Campaign Playlists' as entity, COUNT(*)::text FROM campaign_playlists
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Algorithmic', COUNT(*)::text FROM campaign_playlists WHERE is_algorithmic = true
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Vendor', COUNT(*)::text FROM campaign_playlists WHERE is_algorithmic = false;
"
```

**Expected:**
- Campaign Playlists: ~1,850
- Algorithmic: ~173
- Vendor: ~1,677

### UI Checks

1. **Open production URL**
2. **Navigate to Campaigns**
3. **Click on "Segan - DNBMF"**
4. **Go to "Playlists" tab**
5. **Verify structure:**
   - ✅ Green "Spotify Algorithmic Playlists" section at top
   - ✅ Red "Vendor Playlists" section below
   - ✅ Stream counts visible
   - ✅ Vendor information displayed

6. **Test other campaigns:**
   - Kitt Wakeley
   - All American Rejects
   - PROPPAGANDA
   - Carbon Sigil

4. ✅ Confirm "Segan - DNBMF" structure works

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Monitor for issues
2. Train team on new features
3. Gather user feedback
4. Document any bugs

### Long Term (Future)
1. Scrape more campaigns with valid SFA links

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Scripts are idempotent** - Safe to re-run if something fails
2. **Frontend auto-deploys** - Vercel handles this automatically
3. **Database migrations already applied** - From previous deployment
4. **Only data import needed** - The new playlists
5. **Zero downtime** - Data import happens in background

---

## 📞 Support

If issues occur:
1. Check logs: `docker logs supabase_db_arti-marketing-ops --tail 100`
2. Re-run import scripts (they're safe to re-run)
3. Check `PRODUCTION-SYNC-COMPLETE.md` troubleshooting section
4. Verify environment variables are set

- [ ] Navigate to `/root/arti-marketing-ops`
- [ ] Have deployment command ready
- [ ] Backup created (optional, scripts are safe)
