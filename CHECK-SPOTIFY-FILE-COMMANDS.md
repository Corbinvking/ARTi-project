# Check Spotify File Location

## 🔍 **Check if spotify.ts exists and where it compiles to:**

```bash
# 1. Check if spotify.ts exists in the source
docker exec supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops ls -la /app/src/routes/providers/

# 2. Check what's in the dist directory
docker exec supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops find /app/dist -name "*spotify*" -type f

# 3. Check the full directory structure
docker exec supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops ls -la /app/dist/routes/

# 4. Check if providers.js has the import line
docker exec supabase_api_arti-marketing-ops grep -n "spotify" /app/dist/routes/providers.js
```

## 🎯 **What We're Looking For:**
- Does `spotify.ts` exist in `/app/src/routes/providers/`?
- Where did it compile to (if anywhere)?
- Is the import statement present in `providers.js`?

**Run these commands to see exactly where the spotify file is!** 🔍
