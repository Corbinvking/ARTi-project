# üîç Production Situation Summary

## ‚úÖ **What's Working:**

### Local Environment:
- ‚úÖ **653 campaigns** synced from CSV
- ‚úÖ **110 SFA URLs** collected (Roster Scraper)
- ‚úÖ **110 songs** scraped (Stream Data)
- ‚úÖ **69 campaigns** have playlist data (1,706 playlists)
- ‚úÖ **90 SFA URLs** saved to database
- ‚úÖ All data visible in local UI

---

## ‚ùå **What's Not Working:**

### Production Environment:
- ‚ùå Import script gets JWT error
- ‚ùå Can't find campaigns by track ID
- ‚ùå 0 playlists imported

---

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis:**

The JWT error is a **symptom**, not the problem. The real issues are:

1. **Production database might not have the same 653 campaigns**
   - Local has campaigns synced from `full-databse-chunk.csv`
   - Production campaigns were synced earlier (might be different)

2. **Track ID mismatch**
   - Scraped data has specific track IDs
   - Production campaigns might have different track IDs in their `url` fields
   - Or the campaigns simply don't exist

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Sync Production Database First**

Before importing scraped data, we need to ensure production has the SAME 653 campaigns as local.

### Step 1: Sync Database on Production
```bash
# On production SSH
cd /root/arti-marketing-ops

# Run the full database sync
node scripts/run_full_database_sync.js
```

This will:
- Import 653 campaigns from CSV
- Create/update clients
- Create/update vendors
- Link relationships
- Create campaign groups

### Step 2: Then Import Scraped Data
```bash
# After campaigns are synced, import will work
SUPABASE_URL=$(supabase status | grep "API URL" | awk '{print $3}') && \
ANON_KEY=$(supabase status | grep "Publishable key" | awk '{print $3}') && \
SERVICE_KEY=$(supabase status | grep "Secret key" | awk '{print $3}') && \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="$SUPABASE_URL" \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="$ANON_KEY" \
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="$SERVICE_KEY" \
node scripts/import-roster-scraped-data.js
```

## üìä **Expected Results After Sync:**

```
‚úÖ Data files processed: 79
‚úÖ Campaigns updated: 69
‚úÖ Playlists processed: 1,706
```

---

## üéØ **Quick Action Plan:**

1. ‚úÖ **Verify local is working** (DONE - everything works!)
2. ‚è≥ **Sync production database** with same 653 campaigns
3. ‚è≥ **Then import scraped data** to production
4. ‚è≥ **Verify production UI** shows playlist data

---

## üí° **Why This Matters:**

The import script matches scraped data to campaigns by **Spotify track ID**. If production doesn't have campaigns with matching track IDs (or the campaigns don't exist), the import will fail to find them.

By syncing the database first, we ensure production has the exact same campaigns as local, making the import successful.
